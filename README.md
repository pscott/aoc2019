# Advent Of Code 2019
Having some fun trying out this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019)!

Using [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) for simplicity (although initial setup was tedious!).

## DISCLAIMER
My solutions are often times not safe (lots of unwrap, indexing without checking etc...), and not commented.
This is not what I would write for production code! :D
